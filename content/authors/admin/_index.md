Hi there! My name is Ezra M. Wingard, and I am a 2023 Graduate of SUNY Oswego, currently working on the SC-WB Study under Dr. Caitlin Hudac at the University of South Carolina.. I have varying research interests, but the major question I seek to answer is "What is it like?" Current avenues of research that I am pursuing include: how our personal identity affects behaviors within adolescent social behaviors.

I am always open to making new connections with researchers and scientists. If you're interested, feel free to contact me via email or text!
