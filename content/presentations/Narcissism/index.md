summary: When narcissists are forced to 'feel bad' about their actions, they become less defensive.
abstract: 'The principal aim of this study was to determine whether experimentally induced ruminating
about an unpleasant personal experience (in comparison to accepting it and or distancing from
it) influenced how persons defensively seek out information about themselves, and whether
narcissistic tendencies moderate this link. Before visiting out lab, participants completed the
Narcissistic Personality Inventory (Raskin & Terry, 1988). Then, during a virtual laboratory visit
on Zoom, participants engaged in our novel Emotional Re-Experiencing Task (ERET). Participants
were first asked to think about an event in which they seriously hurt somebody’s feelings (or
they seriously let somebody down), to write down a short description about the memory, and
then to reflect on it using one of three conditions. In the Rumination Condition, participants
reflected on the event using several audio and visual prompts such as “Think as deeply as
possible about this event, like it’s still happening right now, and “Memories stick with us over
and over.” In the other two conditions, participants were either instructed to Accept the event
as part of their life story (e.g., “Life has its ups and downs;” “You live and learn”) or Distance
themselves from it (“That stuff is in the past now;” “It’s water under the bridge.”) Then, after
completing the ERET, participants were led to believe that other students from another college
would read the description of the unfavorable memory event and answer questions about the
participants. Participants could choose 5 of 20 available questions that they wanted answered,
which captured participants’ desire to defend against unpleasant feedback from others (e.g.,
Why was this person "within his/her rights" to get upset at their friend; What makes this person
good at "taking care of himself/herself first” during unsettled times?). Preliminary results
(shown in Figure 1) indicate that after controlling for general mood, when participant scoring
high on narcissism were asked to ruminate about hurting others, they engage in significantly
less defensive feedback seeking memories (p < .05). However, when participants scoring high
on narcissism were asked to distance themselves from thinking about hurting another person,
they became significant more defensive (p < .05).'
